You can even pair multiple cameras together on the app, if you so dream. Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But considering that the majority of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some additional cash while providing a customer change, for instance), we think it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you require.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
