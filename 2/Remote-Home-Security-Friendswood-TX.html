<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
