<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
