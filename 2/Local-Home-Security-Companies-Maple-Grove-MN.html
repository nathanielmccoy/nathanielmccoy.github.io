<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. After looking into 4 different security systems, we picked SSA. They gave us the best description of their services and provided us more for the money. After having a disappointment with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a really professional installation should be. We feel really safe understanding our home is protected by SSA. The New Providence Police Department is devoted to using every resource to prevent and resolve criminal offenses and to safeguard citizens and their home.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
