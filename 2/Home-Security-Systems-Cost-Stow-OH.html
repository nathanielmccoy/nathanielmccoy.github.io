<p>Ring might not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), but it sure has acquired rather the excitement throughout the years.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
