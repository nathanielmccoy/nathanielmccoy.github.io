Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by.
