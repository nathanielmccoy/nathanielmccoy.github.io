<p>Discover how to develop, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and reduce crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being viewed by the authorities - or mindful they might be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be cautious about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers.
