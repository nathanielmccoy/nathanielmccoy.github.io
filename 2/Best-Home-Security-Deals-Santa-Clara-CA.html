<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand out too much. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from your house. The 2nd essential thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill built-in alarm, so it works as a home alarm as well as a security camera. That separates it from the items I have actually already written, and helps in part to describe its price.</p>
