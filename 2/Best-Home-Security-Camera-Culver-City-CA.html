<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
