<p>Among the very best elements of this alarm system is that it has an exceptionally sophisticated motion sensor. Due to the fact that it uses infrared sensors and mass detection to distinguish in between people and other inanimate things or smaller sized living things, it just gets activated when a human comes in close proximity. You get an alert in your mobile phone app if your motion sensing unit is triggered. There's no latency so you get alerted instantly so you can take immediate actions such as triggering a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the potential burglars.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by.
