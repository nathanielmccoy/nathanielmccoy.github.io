<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
