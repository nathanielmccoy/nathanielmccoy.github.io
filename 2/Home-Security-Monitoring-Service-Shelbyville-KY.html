<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the very same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody!

<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a number of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the very first few months.
