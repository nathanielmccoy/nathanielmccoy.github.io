<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. Audio and video confirmation strategies utilize microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image pictures. The source audio and video streams are sent over an interaction link, normally an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the central station where monitors recover the images through exclusive software application. The info is then passed on to police and recorded to an event file, which can be used to plan a more strategical and tactical method of a property, and later on as prosecution evidence.</p>
<p>One of the very first decisions that you'll need to make is if you require a wireless or wired security camera system, and the appropriate response likely depends on where you intend to place the components and cameras. If you have the high-end of being able to drill holes and run wires, you'll appreciate not needing to handle batteries, and may wish to look at a wired system. On the other hand, if running wires isn't practical, you'll delight in the flexibility that Wi-Fi and wireless cameras use. All these considerations will affect what system you ultimately select. For instance, if you need to record high-definition surveillance video over long periods, bandwidth is a factor to consider.</p>

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
