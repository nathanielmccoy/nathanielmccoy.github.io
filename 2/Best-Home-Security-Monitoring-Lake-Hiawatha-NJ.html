<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal construction.

Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
