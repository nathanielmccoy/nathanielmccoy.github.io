<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>This is the best-scoring clever alarm we evaluated. It was very simple to establish, as the elements are pre-paired to the base station, and it was quick to set off when any of the sensing units were activated.

The alarm doesn't include a wifi security camera but you can acquire a variety of different Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring option with this alarm.</p>
