<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms.
