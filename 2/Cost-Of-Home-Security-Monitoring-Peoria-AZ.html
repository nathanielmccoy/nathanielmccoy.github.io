<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of removing costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately shut off the heater. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can instantly make the clever lights turn on to frighten prospective burglars.</p>

<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be viewed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may learn to be careful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers." Certainly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
