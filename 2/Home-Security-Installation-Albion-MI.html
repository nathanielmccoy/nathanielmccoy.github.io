<h3>Wireless Home Alarm Systems in Albion MI</h3>
<p>Brinks Home Security, among the established names in the industry, just recently received a facelift after MONI Smart Security bought the name rights to the company and provided the company a severe overhaul. The enhanced and new Brinks Home Security uses MONI monitoring and Livewatch DIY security systems for a more contemporary plan.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
