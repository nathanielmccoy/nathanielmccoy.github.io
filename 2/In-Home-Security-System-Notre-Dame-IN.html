Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
