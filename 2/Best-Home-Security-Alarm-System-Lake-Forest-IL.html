Siren A number of one-box systems like Canary and Somfy include an extremely loud built-in siren that should hopefully scare off intruders (or next door's feline).

<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing multiple sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor notifies the customer. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a fail safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
