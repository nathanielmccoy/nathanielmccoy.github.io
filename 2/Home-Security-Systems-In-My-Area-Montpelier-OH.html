The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction.

Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
