<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.

Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is very easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to manage nearly every element of the security system from another location, and it's highly customizable.
