Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to save and how long you prepare to keep recorded footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly.
