<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
