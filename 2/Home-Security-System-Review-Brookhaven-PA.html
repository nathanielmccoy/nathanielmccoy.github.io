<p>Thanks to recent developments in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you have actually made the decision to install an alarm system, you should think about the following advantages of wireless innovation. For some, that might be worth the $300 cost. But while we like the smart functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Camera IQ, a number of the cameras we looked at deal the very same benefits at a more affordable price. Manage your home no matter where you are with the Vivint Smart Home app. Use your mobile phone to speak and see with visitors at your door, see and secure packages, track activity with stored video clips, or communicate with family in your home. With security camera control in the palm of your hand, comfort is yours.</p>

For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>
