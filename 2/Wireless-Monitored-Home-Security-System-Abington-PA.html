Not just is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out precisely what it's looking at. Simply a couple years ago, the home security industry was dominated by a few huge names using expensive, stiff strategies with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting agreements.
