<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Many insurance companies use discounts on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of cops departments offer numerous "complimentary" false alarms before enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is significant right from the start.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
