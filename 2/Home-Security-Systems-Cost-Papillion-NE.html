<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
