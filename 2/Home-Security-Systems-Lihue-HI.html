Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
