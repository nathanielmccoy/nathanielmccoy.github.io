<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.
