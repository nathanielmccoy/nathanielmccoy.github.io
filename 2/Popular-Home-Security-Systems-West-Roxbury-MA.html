<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of removing costly incorrect alarms.
