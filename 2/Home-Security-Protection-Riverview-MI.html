As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings went through extended surveillance.</p>
