Search for a design that provides a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and economical cloud storage for tape-recorded video.

<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. If a patient is having difficulty, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is normally open or usually closed.
