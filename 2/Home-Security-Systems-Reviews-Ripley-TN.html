When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
