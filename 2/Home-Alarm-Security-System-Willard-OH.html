<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
