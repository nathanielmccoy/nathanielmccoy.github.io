Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
