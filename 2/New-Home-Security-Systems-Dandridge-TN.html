<p>This nifty wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly setting off when movement was discovered. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth noting that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
