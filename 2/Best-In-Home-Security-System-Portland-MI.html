<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
