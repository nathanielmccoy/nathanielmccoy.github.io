<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that.
