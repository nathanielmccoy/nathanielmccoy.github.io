<p>Most modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs convert the analog video footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video, and also permits users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several areas. Frequently, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more figured out intruders.
