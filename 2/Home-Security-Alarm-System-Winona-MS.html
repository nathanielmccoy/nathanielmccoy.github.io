<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent.

Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
