<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of removing pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating unit. If the motion sensors are triggered, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers.</p>
