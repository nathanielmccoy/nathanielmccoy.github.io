<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for brief battery life without a doubt.

For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a lamp inside your home or activate an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
