Home automation is easy and convenient, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home devices are by their very nature wireless, and a lot of home security companies provide a home automation package with an app to from another location manage whatever on the system. That isn't to say that you can't have wired home automation, due to the fact that you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure.

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
