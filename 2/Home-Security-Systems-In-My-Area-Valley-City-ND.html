<p>This system utilizes an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based upon two unshielded (or 'leaking') coaxial cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter gives off continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television.

The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to appropriately identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop.
