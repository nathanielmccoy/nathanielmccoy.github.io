<p>Many home security systems include DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I ensure that that's a simple procedure.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 per month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked only about half of the camera and the time routinely detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network appeared fine).
