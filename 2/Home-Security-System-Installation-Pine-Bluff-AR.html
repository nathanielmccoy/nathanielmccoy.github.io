<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
