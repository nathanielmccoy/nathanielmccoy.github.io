<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
