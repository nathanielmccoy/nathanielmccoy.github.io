In addition, the motion sensing unit here is much more sophisticated than the ones provided by adobe Beginner Set.

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated clever home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>

You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, particularly for cameras.
