<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras decrease crime. HD CCTV systems are compatible with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TV that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that implies you have standard analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure if you buy HD-CCTV security system.

If  authorities are contacted for an incorrect alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching police needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for false alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
