CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by altering a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and lowering justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Nurse calling systems typically include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's washroom. If a patient is having problem, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is generally open or generally closed.
