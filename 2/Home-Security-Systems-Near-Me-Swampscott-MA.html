This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
