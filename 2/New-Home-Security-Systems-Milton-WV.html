After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
