<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
