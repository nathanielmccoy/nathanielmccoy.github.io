<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
