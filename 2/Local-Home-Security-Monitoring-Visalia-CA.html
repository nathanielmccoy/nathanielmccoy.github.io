<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information.
