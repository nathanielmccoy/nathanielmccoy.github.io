<p>Thanks to current improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you should consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. eBay makes it easy to browse by rate, condition, the number of cameras included and more. We've discovered lots here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brands available. Sometimes you do not have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use just expert installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY option. ADT doesn't have the greatest customer support reputation among the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this up to the reality that ADT has a number of million more consumers than its rivals, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>

A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just wouldn't connect. An aid window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might inform there was a problem with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the representative apologized and shipped her replacement control board overnight.</p>
