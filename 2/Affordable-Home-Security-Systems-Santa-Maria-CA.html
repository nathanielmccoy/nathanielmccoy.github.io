<p>No charge will be examined for the first and 2nd false alarm event within the city's fiscal year (July 1 through June 30). 2. In the event the burglar alarm system is a monitored system, it is the duty of the company monitoring the burglar alarm system to notify anyone recognized in the registration at the demand of the AHJ.

Alarms activated by legal but accidental entry to the property, i.e. kids returning home, visitors, next-door neighbors caring for the home while you are on vacation and shipment guys do not satisfy the standard for waiver.</p>
