<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>Analog hd cameras are a fantastic alternative for organisations to update from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable television.
