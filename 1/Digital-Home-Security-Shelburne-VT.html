<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
