<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their mobility, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike property owners, usually prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other parts can quickly be established at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too. Wireless security plans also permit remote control of the system and basic home automation.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
