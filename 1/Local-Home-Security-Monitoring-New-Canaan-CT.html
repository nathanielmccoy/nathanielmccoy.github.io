<h2>Wireless CCTV Camera New Canaan</h2>
<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a dispute that's frequently skewed by elements such as suspicion over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and problems that trigger incorrect alarms. While improvements in recent years have actually made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own special wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that do not affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
