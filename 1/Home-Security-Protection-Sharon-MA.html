As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
