With HeimVision wireless surveillance system, you can customize the detection zone through the NVR to get and minimize false alarms notifies of suspicious motions more precisely.</p>

Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by.

<p>Since the glass housing doesn't get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they offset it in abilities. In addition to being great for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared given that the glass housing does not restrain the lens. With some, it's tough to tell at a glimpse where they've been aimed, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their real field of view.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
