<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
