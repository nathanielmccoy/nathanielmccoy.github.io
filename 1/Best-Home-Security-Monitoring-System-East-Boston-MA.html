<p>However, convenience doesn't always feature included security. Going from wired to wireless security implies potentially exposing yourself to outside attacks if you don't do it right.

Without taking the proper security preventative measures, you could be leaving your home available to burglars who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensing units getting their presence.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to use, specifically if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it permits you to manage practically every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's extremely customizable.

Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, including smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
