If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, however practically all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
