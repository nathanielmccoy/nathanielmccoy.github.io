It also includes two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an alternative for more ), which can cram in clips of approximately 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

But these integrations aren't quite as robust as the home or Ring systems.</p>
