<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
