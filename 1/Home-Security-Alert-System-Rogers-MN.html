<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (frequently extremely high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with an expert monitoring company.

Then, the monitoring company immediately sets to action, getting in touch with you and informing the authorities.</p>
