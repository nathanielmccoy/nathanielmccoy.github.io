<p>No incorrect alarm penalties: House owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm. Considering that the property owner is in charge of the system, cops are only contacted if there's a real emergency. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will get in touch with authorities if a house owner can't confirm a false alarm. If  cops are gotten in touch with for a false alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
