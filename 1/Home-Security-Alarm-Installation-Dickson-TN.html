Tenants, unlike homeowners, normally avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can easily be established at various properties later, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.
