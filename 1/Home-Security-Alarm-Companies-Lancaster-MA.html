<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
