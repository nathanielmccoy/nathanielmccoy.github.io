<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
