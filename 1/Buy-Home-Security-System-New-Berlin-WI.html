Wireless systems, on the other hand, utilize a WiFi connection, fast to set up, and can be positioned anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>
<p>Piza and colleagues (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that looked at the impacts of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on criminal offense prevention.

Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and contacting leading researchers to ask about upcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
