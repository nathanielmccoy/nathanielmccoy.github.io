When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  technique to robbery reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
