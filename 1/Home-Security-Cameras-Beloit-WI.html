It makes no sense that we don't have comparable laws for video recording. Wireless security systems use radio frequency (RF) or in some cases Wi-Fi connections to connect security sensors to the overall system. Z-Wave and Zigbee are a few of the more common wireless innovations used by major security companies. Here are a couple of things wireless systems provide over standard hardwired systems.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
