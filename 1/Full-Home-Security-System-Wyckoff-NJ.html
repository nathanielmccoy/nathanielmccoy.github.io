<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was developed for house owners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, as soon as installed, is hard to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for large homes and are typically more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your house.
