The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.
