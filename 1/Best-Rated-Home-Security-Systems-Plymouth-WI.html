<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself.
