<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
