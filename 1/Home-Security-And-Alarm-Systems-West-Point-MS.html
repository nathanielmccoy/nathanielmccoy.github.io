Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
