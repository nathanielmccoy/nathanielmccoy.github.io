The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and watch it later on.

<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they might be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has mentioned, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may discover to be mindful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>

But for normal applications, connectivity concerns are managed by typical guidance messages, sent daily or weekly.</p>
<p>For the most part, wireless security equipment is just as noticeable as you want it to be. Window sensors are easily hid behind blinds or curtains, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe. You can hide a wireless camera much easier than you can one with wires.

Wireless systems are also ideal for renters because they don't require opening the wall, and can quickly be taken with you when you move to your next place.
