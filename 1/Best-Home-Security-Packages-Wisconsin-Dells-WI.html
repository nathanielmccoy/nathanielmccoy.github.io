The response depends upon a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to save and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store.
