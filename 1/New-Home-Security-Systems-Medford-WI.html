<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated wise home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I tested, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Worth keeping in mind: you can likewise get an outdoor version (â¤ 199.99, Amazon) which is essentially the exact same but with a variety added features.

Furthermore, most unmonitored security systems will send informs to your smart device, making it simple to understand if there's a hazard to your property.</p>
