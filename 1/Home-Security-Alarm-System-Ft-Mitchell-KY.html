<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas.

The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
