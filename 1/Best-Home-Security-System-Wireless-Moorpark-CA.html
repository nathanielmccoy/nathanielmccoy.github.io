<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential wrongdoers are less most likely to dedicate criminal offense if they think they are being enjoyed or have a higher threat of being nabbed. This is also called the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by changing a range of systems such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and minimizing provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

House owners with children or who spend a great deal of time far from home might prefer multiple surveillance alternatives throughout the home that provide live video feeds. You'll be in a good position to choose amongst the various types of equipment used when you have actually determined the requirements of your household.</p>

It is among the very best systems we've tested, with customizable alarm sets off and constant monitoring action times.

SimpliSafe also works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to equip and check the system using only voice commands.

Catastrophe protection - you can connect a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide gas alarm to the app. Disadvantage: some systems have a high rate of false alarms due to the fact that some of these sensors may be too sensitive.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
