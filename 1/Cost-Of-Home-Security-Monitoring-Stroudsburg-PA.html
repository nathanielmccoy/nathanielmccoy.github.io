<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera System Stroudsburg PA 18360</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit restricted to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>Vivint utilizes both wireless sensing units and cellular interaction in all of its security packages.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
