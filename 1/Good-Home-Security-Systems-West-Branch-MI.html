(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since most retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some additional money while offering a customer modification, for instance), we think it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the proof you need. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>The Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) file encryption standard was the original file encryption standard for wireless, however considering that 2004 with the ratification WPA2 the IEEE has declared it "deprecated", 17 and while often supported, it is hardly ever or never ever the default on modern equipment.
