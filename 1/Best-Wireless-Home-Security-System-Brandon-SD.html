<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not need a new keypad. Using numerous sensors to monitor activity in one area, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector journeys in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor informs the customer.

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
