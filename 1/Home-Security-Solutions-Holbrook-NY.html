<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
