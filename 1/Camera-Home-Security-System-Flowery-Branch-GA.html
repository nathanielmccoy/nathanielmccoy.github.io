<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, scams, and theft. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each action is billed.

Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more precise and less frequent signals.</p>
