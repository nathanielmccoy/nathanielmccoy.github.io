<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, scams, and theft. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically turn off the heater.

Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in many cases, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most resilient. Since their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor alternatives. In terms of detection, it is better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more precise and less frequent signals.</p>
