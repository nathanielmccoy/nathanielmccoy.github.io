<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free benefits like individual detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 each month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked only about 50 percent of the camera and the time regularly disconnected from the network numerous times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).
