You might invest a similar amount for the best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. However, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be a cost effective choice for clients in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems because they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't offered. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>

If  cops are contacted for a false alarm, property owners might have to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for false alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
