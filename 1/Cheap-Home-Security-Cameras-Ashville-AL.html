<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later created to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption plans, any customer in the network that knows the keys can check out all the traffic.</p>
