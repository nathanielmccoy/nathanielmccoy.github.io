<p>It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that uses two-way audio, go for it. Tenants and others who are not sure for how long they will be remaining in their current house needs to prevent entering long-term agreements.

Nevertheless, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
