<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
