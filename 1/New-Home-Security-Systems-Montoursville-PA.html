In this manner, you don't need to remember to shut off the camera's monitoring functions every time you come home. For this to work effectively, every user in the home (consisting of kids) would require the app set up and geofencing allowed on their phones.

The main distinction is that the wired system pairs with the other wise home gadgets to create a network of home security around your home.
