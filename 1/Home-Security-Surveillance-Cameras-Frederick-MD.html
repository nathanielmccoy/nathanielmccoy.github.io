<p>Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense. When a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
