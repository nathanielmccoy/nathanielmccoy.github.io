ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, Do It Yourself variation of the ADT system, and we like its cameras better than the traditional" ADT versions. The camera can tape video in approximately 1080p, which looks perfectly fine on a smartphone screen and won't tax your internet connection too much. Netatmo also enables you to tweak the settings for each private user - for example, don't tape Abbie, but do record Ben. It's actually quite wise.</p>
<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the exact same membership model and same app as the original Nest Camera Outdoor, however it adds in more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking feature (which follows an individual around the viewing location), better audio, a stronger mount, and a broader operating temperature level variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, but that added security makes for a more difficult installation procedure, and it costs practically twice the cost of the Nest Webcam Outdoor.</p>
