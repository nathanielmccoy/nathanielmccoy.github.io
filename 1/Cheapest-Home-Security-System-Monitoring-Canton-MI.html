The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.
