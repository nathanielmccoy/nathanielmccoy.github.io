<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision choice, but the black and white variation can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't truly a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's rate and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the aid of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
