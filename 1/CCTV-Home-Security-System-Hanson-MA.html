<p>When it pertains to preventing possible burglaries, brand name recognition has considerable value. In reality, a study from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Department of Criminal Justice & Criminology found that a security indication was more of a deterrent to intruders than outdoor lighting and a neighborhood watch.

<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. When someone rings the doorbell, it triggers the doorbell camera.
