<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
