<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>Simply put, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work utilizing radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to get sensors required to manage your equipment consisting of allowing, disabling and sending you instant alerts. As soon as a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, web, email, or text portal.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
