<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
