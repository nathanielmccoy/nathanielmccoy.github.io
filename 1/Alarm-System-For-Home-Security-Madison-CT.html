<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were extremely helpful and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they carried out with professionalism and competence. I'm unsure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially at night when weather conditions actually mess with the night vision.

<p>Arlo Pro 2 likewise has an impressive Night Vision feature. It is equipped with infrared lenses that permit the camera to record videos even in complete darkness.

As such, even if someone breaks into your home in complete darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your smartphone app. The only concern here is that the recorded video will be white and black and a little dark so you may not have the ability to see information clearly.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
