Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen regularly enough. Another possible downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.

And since ADT offers very same- and next-day installation, you can get that additional security in no time, which appears like good value.</p>
