<h3>Wireless Security Home System Nevada City CA 95959</h3>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable from the DVR into the camera.

DVR systems are hard to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire a completely new DVR before including another camera to the system.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.
