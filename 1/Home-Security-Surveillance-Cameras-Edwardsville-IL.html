If the monitoring specialists don't get a response from you or if they get a distress code, they'll rapidly dispatch the authorities to come and check on you.</p>
<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (often extremely high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
