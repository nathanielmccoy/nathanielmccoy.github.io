Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options because their design allows for minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will supply more precise and less regular notifies because often times the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
