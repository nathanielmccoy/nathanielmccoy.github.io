<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the maker's stats since this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for short battery life by far.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
