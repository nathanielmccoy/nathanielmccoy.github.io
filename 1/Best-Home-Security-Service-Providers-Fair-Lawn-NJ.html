<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Spend some time to check out online reviews and not just those on the company's site. Look at the Better Business Bureau website particularly. If a client has actually a lodged a grievance about the company, its personnel, or its equipment, it will be on that site. Other third-party reviews websites need to be inspected as well. Consider asking neighbors for recommendations on security systems too. They might even recommend a local company with a strong track record that can expertly install the equipment.</p>
