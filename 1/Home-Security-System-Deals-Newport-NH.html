<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced clever home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Put simply, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensing units required to control your equipment consisting of making it possible for, disabling and sending you immediate alerts. As soon as a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, email, text, or web portal. If your wireless home security system is expertly monitored, they'll also get an alert to right away help you with emergency situation responders as needed.</p>

If you go away for a few days, a membership also makes sure that you'll be covered. The Circle Safe Basic strategy offers 2 week of video storage for $4 each month per camera (compared with $5 for 5 days for Nest Aware). The $10 Premium plan bumps that as much as 31 days of storage (compared to $10 for 10 days for Nest Aware) and includes motion zones, filter alternatives, and the capability to differentiate in between individuals and other objects.</p>
