It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

It also works with IFTTT so you can set up specific commands regarding how different gadgets ought to function in response to your Canary device's numerous sensors.
