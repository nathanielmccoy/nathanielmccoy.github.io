<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Renters, unlike house owners, generally prevent making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can quickly be set up at different properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too.
