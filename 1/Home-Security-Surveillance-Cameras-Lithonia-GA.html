<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and scams. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
