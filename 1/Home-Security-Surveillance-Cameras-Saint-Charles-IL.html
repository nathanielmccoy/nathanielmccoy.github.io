The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
