Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no gaps in between.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
