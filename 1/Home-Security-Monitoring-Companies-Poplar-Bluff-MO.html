<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
