<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensors, cameras, and various detectors all connected to a primary control panel via radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
