<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Tip: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a certain level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating systems. You can immediately make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers if the motion sensing units are set off.</p>

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
