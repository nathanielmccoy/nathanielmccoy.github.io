<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most tough setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You need to play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs groan, cats squeal, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds.
