<p>Video recording isn't a basic option on most security systems. Property owners looking for a system that offers video recording should make certain the option is available instead of assume it is. Saving video is also a concern. Video files are large, which means a lot of area is needed. There are a handful of companies that use totally free video storage, but the video is sent out to a cloud account and just kept for a couple of days.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs howl, cats shriek, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
