ADT utilizes an independent supplier model involving third-party dealerships. The dealerships determine which equipment to utilize. Expenses for systems differ. Larger systems that offer full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most expensive alternatives. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most affordable option.</p>
