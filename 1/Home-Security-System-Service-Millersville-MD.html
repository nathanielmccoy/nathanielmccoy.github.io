<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is among the most costly home security cameras around, but it's also among the most intelligent, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone range and HDR support for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery option here, sorry-- however the camera includes a 25-foot power cable, which must help with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.
