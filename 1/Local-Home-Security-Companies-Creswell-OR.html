<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to keep and for how long you prepare to keep documented video footage. The footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still require.</p>

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. Several cities also require a license to even own and operate a home security system.
