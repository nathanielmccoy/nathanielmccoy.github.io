<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
