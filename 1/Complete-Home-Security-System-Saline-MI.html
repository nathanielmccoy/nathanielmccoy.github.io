In the event the alarm system system is a monitored system, it is the responsibility of the company monitoring the burglar alarm system to notify anybody recognized in the registration at the demand of the AHJ.

It can be controlled from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control panel (likewise referred to as the alarm panel).

Key fobs, mobile phone GPS and even smart face-recognition software can help keep an eye on the kids or a senior relative and let you know when they get home securely, or if they leave the house unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
