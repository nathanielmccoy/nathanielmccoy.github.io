<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. Select either landline or the correct interactive service if using 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet. Select billing period: Regular monthly or Yearly. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL main station provider which we pass on to our yearly consumers.
